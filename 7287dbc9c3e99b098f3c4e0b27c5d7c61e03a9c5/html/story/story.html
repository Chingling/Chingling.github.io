    I finally got to writing this. It’s still in progress. It feels awkward for me to put our experiences into words like this,
    but I’ll try my best. What we had and did together I will never forget, and I hope that this can serve as a reminder. If I
    get some things mixed up, I’m sorry, my ordering of events isn’t the best. I’m trying to remember every detail, every moment
    we had, I don’t want it to slip away. But it is something I don’t think that I can ever properly put into words, or any
    other kind of description. Truly nothing can describe the happiness and excitement that I felt during that week, the joy that
     you gave me. The joy that you have always given me.
